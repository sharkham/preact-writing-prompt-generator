# Preact Writing Prompt Generator

Stuck on what to write? Try this simple writing prompt generator!

Preact Writing Prompt Generator is a single page Preact app where users can generate writing prompts from multiple lists of words (currently a general set of random words or a set of nautical terms).

This is the Preact version of my React prompt generator, which can be found [here](https://github.com/sharkham/prompt-generator) and tried out [here](https://promptgenerator.netlify.app/).
